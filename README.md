# Vina Helper

Vina Helper is a user friendly, GUI automatization of the AutoDock Vina program. It is still under development but feel free to use it and provide feedback. 

Run the gui.py file to start using Vina Helper. 

After giving the program all the information press make, and then press the OS you're using. The output should appear in the same folder the program is located. 

I want to clarify that AutoDock Vina is not my program, Vina Helper is just a GUI tool for the program. 

Feel free to email me at elaboytorres@gmail.com

Enjoy :)
